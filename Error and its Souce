                                               Permission Denial
                                               
Denial of acess through some file  in Unix system both Linex and Unix has been designed to restrict and prohibite
newbies from destroying their own systems hence Unix is an open System. 
This error is mainly caused due to the restrictions embaded into the Unix system in order not to harm themself.
Here is an Example of it when we want to append, edit   (php.ini ) the system deniel is imforced.

Error:
codes 1:
~MacBookAir:/etc/php/7.4/cli$ sudo vi echo "zend_extension=/etc/php/7.4/cli/xdebug" >> /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini exit
bash: /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini
: Permission denied

codes 2: 
~MacBookAir:/etc/php/7.4/cli$ vi echo "zend_extension=/etc/php/7.4/cli/xdebug" >> /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini exit
bash: /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini
: Permission denied

Solution:
The use of 'tee' , 'grep' with 'sudo' eradicate this problem and easy the pass to the Restiction on the file and makes its possible to append.
format:
echo "Put your text thats you wants to append here" | sudo tee -a <file you wants to append to>
press "Enter",
will be prompt for password of your system and done!

example:
/$ echo "xdebug.remote_host = host.docker.internal" | sudo tee -a php.ini exit
[sudo] password for [$User]: 
#This is appended and done
xdebug.remote_host = host.docker.internal
